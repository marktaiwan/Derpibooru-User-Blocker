# Marker's User Blocker
Allows you to hide image comments and forum posts from select users.

Does not hide user's PMs, uploaded images, or forum threads.

Requires the installation of [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/).

### How to use:
Go to a user's profile page and click on the link that says "Hide user's comments".

You can view the list of blocked users by going to Derpibooru's [Settings](https://derpibooru.org/settings?active_tab=userscript) page, under the 'Userscript' tab.
